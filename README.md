# Cardomancy
## Lane-based card combat

## Inspiration
We were inspired by virtual card games like Inscryption, Balatro, Slay the Spire, Teamfight Tactics, and Hearthstone.
## How we built it
We built this game in Unity. We decided to create a 3D project for a unique graphical look.
## Challenges we ran into
We did not consider the scope of the project, and had to roll back many of the features we had planned. We had planned out a very complex card game with multiple resources that had to be managed, synergies, buffs, and modifiers.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the systems we created that allow the player to place cards in certain places on the board, and the combat system that follows the player-defined layout.
## What we learned
Project structure, version control, balancing game mechanics, and much more!
## What's next for Cardomancy
We would love to include all of the features we initially planned on including:
- Modifier Card Shop
- Card Upgrades
- Specialized Commanders
- Randomized/Procedurally Generated Cards and Synergies
- Troop/Resource Drain (every round)
